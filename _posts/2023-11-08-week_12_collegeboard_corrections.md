### PBL Unit 3 / Week 12

**Collegeboard Corrections**

1. The correct answer is B because the code segment assigns the initial value of first to temp, then assigns the initial value of second to first. The initial value of first, which has been stored in temp, is then assigned to second. It is not D because the code segment never changes the value of second

7. The correct answer is C because the code segment initially sets start to 1, end to 20, and current to 3. Next, the code segment sets start to the value of current, which is 3. Then current is increased from 3 to 4. It is not B because the value 3 is the final value of start, but not the final value of current.

26. The correct answer is A because this code segment rotates right whenever there is an open square to the right. The robot will move forward from its initial location to the upper-left corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move down two squares, then rotate right, then move forward to the gray square.

41. The correct answer is B because this expression uses theMax procedure to replace the midterm score with the higher of the two scores. The selected value is then added to the final exam score and assigned to One word, adjusted Total. It is not A because this expression assigns only one score to One word, adjusted Total.

55. The correct answer is D because the expression open parenthesis, open parenthesis, response equals, open quotation, y, close quotation, close parenthesis, AND, open parenthesis, response equals, open quotation, yes, close quotation, close parenthesis, close parenthesisalways evaluates to false because it is not possible for the variable response to be equal to both Open quotation, y, close quotation and Open quotation, yes, close quotation. Therefore, the procedure will always return false.

66. The two correct answers are C and D because the procedure returns the first number it encounters that is less than the first number in the list. For the list open bracket, 30, 40, 20, 10, close bracket, the procedure returns 2 0, which is not the least value in the list.

I ended up getting a 60/66. In order to fully grasp all the concepts I missed I watched the videos on collegeboard that were linked to each question.
