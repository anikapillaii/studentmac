### PBL Unit 3 / Week 12

**Team Teach Reflection**

The team teaches project was an engaging and eye-opening experience. It let us explore our own research and learn from other students too. It made our normal school routine more exciting.

Our role was to teach CB 3.9 and 3.15, where we studied how to make algorithms. This let us blend things we already knew like booleans and conditionals with new skills. We could make complex programs to solve tricky problems. The knowledge wasn't just theoretical. We used these new skills in our passion projects.

We used algorithms in our AI and optimizer projects. In the AI, algorithms helped train it and shape its decisions. We had it analyze data to give users smart recommendations based on many factors. Our optimizer processed over 6000 possible stock combos to find the best investments. Complex algorithms made this possible.

Other team teaches were invaluable too. The Boolean module inspired our AI project. We used 'if' statements to see if indicators said to buy certain stocks.

Working together let us see how different concepts connect across subjects. It was unique and enriching beyond normal class. We sharpened technical skills and learned to collaborate, share knowledge, and find inspiration. This made the project unforgettable and transformed our education.
