### PBL Unit 3 / Week 12

**Passion Project Reflection**

Our passion project was the creation of a finance-focused website with numerous features including a stock viewer, data reader, AI assistant, and optimizer. Throughout the development process, I contributed primarily to the frontend design and user experience.

Leveraging my strength in finance from classes like AP Macroeconomics and Finance, I worked extensively on the mathematical and financial components. I explored complex formulas on my student repository and collaborated closely with our backend developers on implementation. Additionally, I helped build an optimizer that analyzed over 6000 scenarios across three key metrics - volatility, profit, and Sharpe ratio.

After making contributing to the mathematical and financial aspects, I transitioned to honing the website's frontend.  Our team held thoughtful discussions on crafting an intuitive, user-friendly interface. We decided on a minimalist style focused on seamless navigation. I integrated engaging features like animated buttons and responsive graphs to enhance interactivity.

This project highlighted the power of combining our individual strengths to uplift a shared vision. Me and Tanay's finance knowledge allowed us to drive key technical features while my teammates leveraged their own skills. Together, we were able to create a comprehensive finance platform greater than the sum of its parts. T
